# Enhanced Analytics Dashboard Implementation

This pull request introduces significant improvements to our analytics dashboard, focusing on user experience, interactivity, and real-time data visualization capabilities. The implementation closely follows the reference design at silver-pegasus-b98a71.netlify.app while adding sophisticated animations and interactions.

## Key Changes

### Theme and Styling Enhancements
- Implemented a polished dark theme that provides excellent contrast and readability
- Custom color palette optimization for data visualization
- Consistent spacing and typography system
- Smooth transitions between interactive states
- Gradient backgrounds for improved visual hierarchy

### Interactive Component Updates

#### MetricCard Component
- 3D hover effects using CSS transforms
- Smooth gradient backgrounds that respond to user interaction
- Optimized animation performance using CSS custom properties
- Responsive scaling for various viewport sizes

#### TimeChart Component
- Custom tooltip implementation with smooth transitions
- Responsive axes that adapt to data ranges
- Animation sequences for data updates
- Improved touch interaction support

#### DropdownSelect Component
- Floating menu animations with proper stacking context
- Keyboard navigation support
- Enhanced focus states
- Smooth transition effects

### Data Management Improvements
- Real-time data refresh capabilities
- Configurable time series generation
- Randomized but realistic metric generation
- Efficient state management for live updates

## Implementation Details

### File Structure Changes

    MetricCard/
      index.tsx
      styles.module.css
    TimeChart/

```

### Performance Considerations
- Implemented React.memo for optimal re-rendering
- Utilized CSS containment for improved paint performance
- Optimized animation frame handling
- Added proper cleanup for event listeners and intervals

## Testing Instructions

1. Development Setup:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Visual Testing:
   - Verify dark theme consistency across all components
   - Test hover interactions on MetricCards
   - Validate TimeChart animations during data updates
   - Check DropdownSelect behavior in various viewport sizes

3. Functionality Testing:
   - Confirm real-time data updates work as expected
   - Verify all interactive elements maintain 60fps
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the interface
   - Validate responsive behavior across breakpoints

## Dependencies Added
- No new production dependencies
- Added `@testing-library/react-hooks` for hook testing

## Notes
- All animations are configurable through CSS custom properties
- Component APIs remain backward compatible
- Documentation has been updated to reflect new features
- Unit tests have been added for new functionality

## Next Steps
- [ ] Traffic source metrics section
- [ ] Landing pages performance table
- [ ] Refresh button animation
- [ ] Metric filtering system
